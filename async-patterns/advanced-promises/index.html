    <h1>Advanced Promises All Exercises</h1>
    <p>Welcome to advanced Promises!</p>
    <p>
      This session we will examine more advanved promise patterns like error
      handling in the promise chain, handling multiple promises, and more. We
      will be using a lot of the same helper functions that we have used in the
      prior sessions. Notice that the randomDelay, output, and getFile functions
      are all helpers.

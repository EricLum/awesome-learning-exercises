/* 
Welcome to the Map and Filter array methods exercises! 

In the following exercises we will utilize map, filter and a few helper methods like includes, some, and every to manipulate collections of data.

// Group Exercise #1 - Write a vanilla JS implementation of map
/* 
In order to better understand map, we want you to write a bare bones vanilla JS version of it. This will by no means be an exhaustive version of map, it's meant as a instructional tool to understand how the real prototype method works. 

Create a function called vanillaMap that takes two inputs:
1. an array of numbers (a list of numbers)
2. a 'callback' function - a function that is applied to each element of the array (inside of the function 'vanillaMap')
Have vanillaMap return a new array filled with numbers that are the result of using the 'callback' function on each element of the input array.
*/
const vanillaMap = (numArray, callback) => {
  // Your solution here
};

export { vanillaMap };

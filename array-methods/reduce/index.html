    <h1>reduce All Exercises</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to basic reduce!</h2>

    <p>
      In the following exercises we will write a version of reduce from scratch
      to better understand how the method works.Then we will use native reduce
      to iterate over collections and return custom data structures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reduce is the culmination of all the previous session.It combines all the
      properties of the previoius iterative methods but it flips the scipt by
      making one simple but powerful change:
    </p>

    <p>
      In reduce, unlike all other methods the transformations and choices you
      make about the values are completely optional.Concider the following * You
      may change the number of elements in the final collection like filter, but
      it's optional.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>You may change the TYPE of object returned, but it's optional.</li>
      <li>You may change the shape of elements like map, but it's optional.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The property of reduce which allows for this FLEXIBILITY is the
      accumulator argument.The accumulator allows us to reason about the final
      result value.

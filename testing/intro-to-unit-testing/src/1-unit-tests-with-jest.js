/**
 * Welcome to Testing - Intro to Unit Tests!
 * Here's a simple function:
 *
 * const add = (a, b) => a + b;
 *
 * To test it, we call it and throw an error if the result
 * doesn't match our expected output.
 *
 * Here's how we would use it:
 * test(add(1, 2), 3); <-- This will not throw an
 * error
 *
 * Generally, in addition to the 'happy path', we
 * want to test edge cases (What happens
 * if we pass a string as an argument? What if we
 * don't pass in enough arguments?)
 *
 * test(add(1), 1); <-- This will throw an error
 *
 * This test will fail, because 1 + undefined evaluates to NaN.
 *
 * Tests are great for telling you your function is
 * not as robust as it needs to be!

/**
 * Exercise 1:
 *
 * Your coworker Alex wrote a function that reverses
 * a string: reverse('Hello') === 'olleH'
 *
 * Write a test for Alex's `reverse` function using Jest. Don't change test2's arguments,
 * use the provided `it` and `expect` arguments to write a test like the below example.
 *
 * The 2 main components of a Jest test are:
 *
 * 1. Description - A summary of what the test checks, which
 * communicates your code's
 * intended behavior to other developers.
 *
 * 2. Assertion - Your check that the function works correctly
 * `expect` and the rest of the Jest API is
 * essentially a wrapper around our error-throwing `if` block.
 *
 * The most basic matcher in Jest is `.toBe`. A matcher is a method
 * to help you validate that the code you are running "matches"
 * what you expect. `toBe()` does a strict equality chexk
 *
 * Jest test syntax looks like this:
 * test('returns the sum of two inputs', () => {
 *    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
 * });
 *

const reverse = str =>
  str.split("").reduce((reversed, letter) => letter + reversed, "");

export const test1 = (it, expect) => {
  // Your code here

/**
 * Exercise 2:
 *
 * Sometimes we want to compare objects. When comparing objects or arrays, `.toBe` won't work
 * unless the objects have the same reference. In other words,
 * expect({ name: 'Alex'}).toBe({ name: 'Alex' }) will fail. We need to use `.toEqual`, which
 * checks that objects or arrays are deeply equal even if they have different references.
 *
 * Alex wrote this factory function that takes a name and array
 * of hobbies and returns a user object. We want a test that
 * make sure it works:
 *
 * Write a test for makeUser, which takes in `name` and `hobbies`
 * arguments, and returns an object with those properties.

/**
 * Exercise 3:
 * Testing allows us to refactor our code confidently,
 * knowing we aren't breaking any functionality, especially
 * if our code touches other parts of the codebase.
 *
 * Our old friend Alex wrote a function `getCartTotal`,
 * which takes an array of wishlist items and returns
 * the total of all items that have been added to the cart.
 *
 * Write a test for getCartTotal that it returns the right total price
 * when calling getCartTotal() with the `wishlistData` array.

    const { price, addedToCart } = wishlist[i];
    if (addedToCart) {
      totalPrice += price;
    }
  }
  return totalPrice;
};

const wishlistData = [
  { id: "4027", addedToCart: true, price: 20.0 },
  { id: "5301", addedToCart: false, price: 20.0 },
  { id: "6711", addedToCart: true, price: 20.0 },
  { id: "1244", addedToCart: false, price: 20.0 },
  { id: "4765", addedToCart: true, price: 20.0 }

export const test3 = (it, expect) => {
  // Your code here
};

const wishlistWithSalePrice = [
  { id: "4027", addedToCart: true, price: 20.0, salePrice: 10.0 },
  { id: "5301", addedToCart: false, price: 20.0, salePrice: 10.0 },
  { id: "6711", addedToCart: true, price: 20.0, salePrice: 10.0 },
  { id: "1244", addedToCart: false, price: 20.0, salePrice: null },
  { id: "4765", addedToCart: true, price: 20.0, salePrice: null }
];

/**
 * Exercise 4: Intro to Test Driven Development
 *
 * We need new functionality for the getCartTotal function -
 * getCartTotal must now add the salePrice instead of price
 * if it is available.
 *
 * However, before we refactor let's write a test to capture this
 * new behavior. Doing this gives us a data-driven
 * way to refactor because we will know when our code works.
 *
 * Write a test for getCartTotal using wishlistWithSalePrice, and expect
 * the total price to include sale price.
 *
 * NOTE: This test will fail until you complete exercise 5
 *
 */

export const test4 = (it, expect) => {
  // Your code here
};

/**
 * Exercise 5
 *
 * Now we have two tests - one testing the original functionality of
 * getCartTotal called with wishlistData and one testing the
 * expected new functionality of getCartTotal called with wishlistWithSalePrice.
 * Modify the getCartTotal function to add the salePrice instead of
 * regular price if it exists and make sure both
 * test 4 and 5 pass once you are done!

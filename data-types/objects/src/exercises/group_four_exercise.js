Group exercise 4 - prevent an object from being changed or mutated

As we can see passing around objects allows us to alter them unlike strings or numbers. 
This demonstrates how objects are "reference types".
We can always reference an object and change some property of it. 
But what if we wanted to protect an object from mutation?

Why is preventing mutation useful in real life applications?
Preventing mutation is used in popular libraries like Immutable.js and Seamless.js. 
These libraries prevent mutations of objects and allow the user to tightly control 
how and when an object changes, 
ultimately preventing commond logic mistakes.

Implement a function below preventMutation(obj) which makes sure that an object cannot 
be modified once the method is invoked.
*/
function preventMutations(obj) {
  // YOUR SOLUTION HERE
}

export { preventMutations };
